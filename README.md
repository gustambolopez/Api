## The bread discord api
ts not really an api but idc
why i made it? idk
## can you use it?
yeah but give credit also the status thingy only works if youre on lanyard server (noooooooooooooo)
## example
so if you wanna use it this an example

```js
https://thebreadapi.vercel.app/v0/user/userid=958708562035638362
```
i added way more stuff but im to lazy to put an example so you will have to look on api endpoints
## hosting in local
use 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gustambolopez/Api.git
```
then
```bash
npm install
node serverjs
```
The bread api should be listening in port 3000
