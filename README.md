## The bread discord api
ts not really an api but idc
why i made it? idk
## can you use it?
yeah but give credit also the status thingy only works if youre on lanyard server (noooooooooooooo)
## Monkey see monkey do
so if you wanna use it this an example

```js
http://thebreadapi/v0/user/userid=958708562035638362
```
or for the guilds the bot is in (no guilds idk why i even included that)
```js
http://localhost:3000/v0/bot/guilds
```
## hosting in local
use 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gustambolopez/Api.git
```
then
```bash
npm install
node serverjs
```
The bread api should be listening in port 3000
